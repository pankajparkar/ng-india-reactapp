This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is simple react app with Angular Component embeded in it. To run angular component inside react app I've placed 3 files compiled from Angular Elements project (Angular Component Packaged as Web Component).

Below three files have been placed on index.html

1.  `<script src="inline.bundle.js"></script>`
2.  `<script src="polyfills.bundle.js"></script>`
3.  `<script src="main.bundle.js"></script>`

#How to run project
1. Install all packages using `npm install`
2. `npm start` to run `react` application
